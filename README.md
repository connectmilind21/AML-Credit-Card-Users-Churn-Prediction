# Credit-Card-Users-Churn-Prediction-Advanced-Machine-Learning
Churn prediction model using Random Forest, Boosting, and SMOTE to identify customers likely to leave credit card services, with insights into key churn factors.


# 💳 Credit Card Churn Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the credit card services sector. The objective is to analyze user behavior and transaction data to identify which customers are likely to discontinue services—and understand the underlying reasons. This enables companies to proactively improve customer retention and reduce revenue loss.

## 📚 Course
Advanced Machine Learning

## 🧠 Skills & Tools Covered
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing
- Random Forest Classifier
- Bagging & Boosting Techniques
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
- Cross Validation
- Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV)

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes customer demographics, transaction behavior, account usage metrics, and service interactions. Some key features:
- Customer Age, Credit Limit, Tenure
- Transactions, Payment Ratio, Utilization
- Contact frequency, late payments, etc.

## 🔍 Project Workflow
1. **EDA**: Understand key customer behavior patterns and feature distributions.
2. **Preprocessing**: Handle class imbalance using SMOTE, encode categorical variables, handle missing values.
3. **Modeling**:
   - Train multiple models: Random Forest, Bagging, Boosting
   - Evaluate using cross-validation
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Use GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to improve model performance.
5. **Interpretation**:
   - Identify top predictors of churn.
   - Provide recommendations for improving retention.
